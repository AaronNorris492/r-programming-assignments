## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Horsepower vs MPG", x = "Horsepower", y = "Miles per Gallon")

```

## Inline Expressions

Finally inline expressions can be written  like this:

This theorem was written by our good friend pythagoreas $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=c$



## Markdown Analysis

Using markdown compared to plain reports seems like it is a more straighforward way to et the point across especially with inline expressions since typed expressons can easily get messy with so many reresented processes like with the quadratic forumla 

x=[-b + or - sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a 

compared to 

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

While the inlline is slightly longer it can actually see the formula not as plain text.
